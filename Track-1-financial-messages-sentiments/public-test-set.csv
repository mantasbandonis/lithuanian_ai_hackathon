Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.. the people who do the research.. said hydroxy has a 91% success rate. However, due to &quot;lack of funds and a peer review&quot; this is not scientifically accepted. It also notes that the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is not getting congressional cooperation because they spoke out against Obamacare in the past. So basically the ones pushing covid are not allowing a proper review of a drug that&#39;s been around for a generation.

It can certainly go under $30 with enough selling pressure.  Or maybe not.  Just as easily we could wake up one day with a buyout priced at $90 or whatever.

It does not matter that for more than 5 years atnm has not complied with its calendar, that patients have not registered, that atnm has had to do R / S, high staff turnover, high salaries, burning of cash, this is not relevant , the pump &amp; dump for years, the lack of information to shareholders.

Cowen survey suggests a brisk uptake and higher than 35% penetration (43%) 5. The above variables will give us final value proposition. 6.

Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.. the people who do the research.. said hydroxy has a 91% success rate. However, due to &quot;lack of funds and a peer review&quot; this is not scientifically accepted. It also notes that the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is not getting congressional cooperation because they spoke out against Obamacare in the past. So basically the ones pushing covid are not allowing a proper review of a drug that&#39;s been around for a generation.

It needs money for another study, and has big delay to resubmit and wait for approval. I guess 15-25% more dilution before profits (not all at once).    MESO has no approved drug, major uncertainty, desperate need for dilutive offering, and revenue estimates of a few hundred million many year from now. It has only 2% short interest, so no support there. But even with huge drop today it still has market cap of $1.4 billion.  Wow.  Meanwhile, $ESPR  has newly approved drugs in huge market with a big demand, it&#39;s flush with $300M+ in cash (~$60M more coming in Q4), is on track to have more than $1B revenue by 2023, has 46% short interest, and $PFE owns about 4.5% and PFE buyout makes sense.  ESPR has a market cap of under $1 billion! Double WOW the other way!!  I don&#39;t get why people chase stuff like MESO when opps like ESPR are available.  GLTA."
"neutral","@superdex75 I think you might be right.  Nestle drove $AIMT under $12 in the days before the buyout.  Many patterns with ESPR look strikingly similar (not identical, but it sure rhymes). But I certainly don&#39;t regret buying additional big blocks of AIMT for $15-16 in July.  Here&#39;s what I do regret: waiting for it AIMT dip into the $10s before buying even more big additional blocks.  Point is, $ESPR is silly cheap at $50, let alone $35.  It can certainly go under $30 with enough selling pressure.  Or maybe not.  Just as easily we could wake up one day with a buyout priced at $90 or whatever.  Or maybe some article for Robinhooders comes out and they attack the big short and start some epic squeeze.  Or maybe the company reports really good new script numbers or ROW partner.  For those reason, I bought quite a bit more today."

But one 100 mil+ volume can smash remaining resistance. 1. 90 day avg (4H chart) : @2.17 2. 50 day avg (daily chart) : @2.26 3. 120 day avg (4H chart) : @2.47 4. 120 day avg (daily chart) &amp; 200 day avg (4Hchart) : @2.53ish  With lower than avg volume (30m shares) it just takes time to break down that resistance.   Some of the major resistance trend lines that were taken down recently. This is why we don&#39;t really go down to 1.7 anymore. 1. Daily chart : 20day avg on Sept 9 2. 4H chart: 20 avg on Sept 9, 50 avg on Sept 17 3. 1H chart: 200 avg on Sept 16  We are very tight ranged. Remember Sept open 2.03 and close 2.03. NO movement.

"positive","$IBIO  IMO, Safi Bio formed, early this year, to get the Geneva contract, based on work by Dr. Rob Thomas. The company is nothing more than this primitive collaboration.  The iBio deal appears to be due to co-founder Jon Mogford, who is part of TAMUS.   Safi probably doesn&#39;t have any money, other than the contract, or any staff or time, to develop the products the Geneva contract needs.   The core of this deal, IMO, is that iBio makes the ten compounds for Safi, they pick which work best for the contract, and iBio gets ownership of the rest.    This is similar to the Planet Biotech deal, but instead of a license, they get ownership.  Isett is making iBio a biopharm development company, taking early stage research and then finalizing and bringing it to market.  This deal, like PB, is a long-term play, offering product line additions at bargain prices.   https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0803406690  https://genevausa.org/programs/4d-bio3/  https://www.neuxtec.com/team/jon-mogford-phd/  https://tinyurl.com/y4mzr9bd"

They announce the meeting almost a week prior. If it were a major partnership, acquisition, or other strategic business initiative of material importance they don&#39;t need the whole exec team to announce that, it would go out via a press release.  2. They haven&#39;t shown any significant growth or demand, except for fluff pieces, rumors, and poorly moderated roundtables.   3. Their market cap is already multiples above where it should be vs. the revenue. So any price increase is basically going into overvalued zone  4. They are burning through cash and will run out in February/March. Backlog most likely isn&#39;t covering and they are going to have to inject further cash... however that is.  5. There is no other indication that they are actively chasing gov/military projects, and seem to be only focusing on &quot;back to work&quot; fluff."

These were from hedge boys like sabby and cvi. From June to August the share count only increased by 15 million which means that the big boys left 10 million unexercised warrants on the table while the price was around .85-.95 with more than 100 percent gain. This does not make any sense for them not to exercise these before the ratio change was announced on aug 12. They didn‚Äôt want almost 10million dollars? Something was up, something is up.

It&#39;s insane to me that people buy $SHOP, having 50% growth with $2 billion in revenue, with a ridiculous $130 billion market cap. Meanwhile Baozun has been selling off despite 25% growth and $1 billion in revenue with a measly $2.5 billion market cap (not to mention, unlike Shopify and $BIGC, actual earnings.) Baozun would need to rise ~2,650% to $915 for the same multiple as Shopify and, despite making 10x the revenue and growing faster, it would still need to rise 2,170% to $755 for the same multiple as BigCommerce.

I don&#39;t think the whole story is being told to the public, as you only hear about the catastrophic side of the illness, not the average Joe that just had a cold.  94 percent of those that died had pre-existing conditions, so did they die of Covid or the condition.  Why on earth is the FDA stalling on the 8 minute antibody test?  Because the medical establishment does not want you to know if you already had it.  Antibody treatment can take care of those that are really sick, the rest of us can just have a week or two of the common cold and this whole BS will be history.  It is really about Vaccine sales and forcing them on the general public."

Then paperwork applications. Because criteria includes not being positive for Covid to enter test, the test must be administered and results provided prior to moving on being a participant.

Of course holding long is not something I have promoted in the least over the past 2+ months now and would lead to huge losses. Averaging down is complete BS but selling today @ .097 or .10 or .093 then opening an Etrade account which allows you to trade freely otc companies for huge gains (if you have the experience) then them buying Zom at .0093, .0097 or even .01 would be a 1000% gain on a possible short lived spike to that level...

The announcement, which is made prior to the delisting by companies themselves if it is a voluntary delisting, or by the exchange, if it is an involuntary delisting, sends the share spiraling down, rendering your investment worthless.  The security may become illiquid. Once a stock is delisted from a main exchange, it will be relegated to trading in the OTCBB or the Pink Sheets. These loosely regulated exchanges do not provide easy access to everyone to trade."
